## Diversity and biogeography of the glacier-fed stream bacterial microbiome

This repository is associated with the NOMIS-funded project 'Vanishing Glaciers' – or what else beside water is lost? Glaciers are melting worldwide at a rapid pace and it becomes critical to better understand how invisible key players in aquatic ecosystems, such as microbes, respond to changing environmental conditions. The River Ecosystems Laboratory (RIVER) at EPFL and collaborators are exploring glacier-fed streams around the world to unravel their associated microbial diversity, biogeography and specific mechanisms developed by microbes to cope in such extreme environments. The Vanishing Glaciers project represents a massive collaborative effort and involves Technical specialists, Civilists, Microbiolgists, Ecologists, Glaciologists from the RIVER lab. at EPFL and collaborators around the globe. This specific repository is associated with the manuscript "Diversity and Biogeography of the global glacier-fed stream bacterial microbiome”.
